# My Portfolio

My portfolio has been generated as part of my bootcamp assignment for week 2

### User Story:
- AS AN employer
- I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
- SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
  
### Outcome:
The application is deemed to meet achieve the user story and acceptance criteria below. The front-end code developed incorporates:
- Semantic HTML elements
- Responsive design, via the utilisation of flexbox and media queries
- Internal and external links (i.e. in-page links to sections and links to external websites and documents such as my CV and GitHub accounts)
- Animation and hover effects to improve the UI
- Project examples
- Information about me, including a profile picture

### The code presented in this repository is deemed to satisfy the following acceptance criteria:
- GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
- WHEN I load their portfolio
- THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
- WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
- THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
- WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
- THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
- WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
- THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
- WHEN I click on the images of the applications
- THEN I am taken to that deployed application
- WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
- THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
